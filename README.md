# Automatic-Room-Light-Controller-with-Bidirectional-Visitor-Counter
Today we are here with automatic room light controller project 
with bidirectional visitor counter by using Arduino Uno. 

It is very interesting project for hobbyists and students for fun as well as learning.

Components
Arduino UNO
Relay (5v)
Resisters
IR Sensor module
16x2 LCD display
Bread Board
Connecting Wires
Led
BC547 Transistor
The project of “Digital visitor counter” is based on the 
interfacing of some components such as sensors, motors etc. with arduino microcontroller.

This counter can count people in both directions. This circuit can be used to count the number of persons entering a hall/mall/home/office in the entrance gate 
and it can count the number of persons leaving the hall by decrementing the count at same gate or exit gate and it depends upon sensor placement in mall/hall.
It can also be used at gates of parking areas and other public places.

This project is divided in four parts: sensors, controller, counter display and gate. 
The sensor would observe an interruption and provide an input to the controller 
which would run the counter increment or decrement depending on entering or exiting of the person
And counting is displayed on a 16x2 LCD through the controller.

When any one enters in the room, IR sensor will get interrupted by the object then other sensor will not work because we have added a delay for a while.
